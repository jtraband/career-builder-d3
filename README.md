# CareerBuilder/d3 Chart Examples

This repository contains example code demonstrating the use of d3. This application will be extended to wrap d3 into Angular components/directives in the near future.

The application is deliberately simple to focus on the minimum necessary code to easily
make use of d3 within an Angular2 application. 

**This is not the perfect arrangement for your application. It is not designed for production. 

## Clone the project 

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```
git clone  https://github.com/jtraband/career-builder-d3  my-proj
cd my-proj
```

## Run it

```
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm install` command will bring down all of the needed dependencies; including any needed d.ts files. 

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.
